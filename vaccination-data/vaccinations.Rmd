## Assignment

Our source data is a COVID-19 table of Israeli hospitalization rates from August 2021.  These data are labeled for patient age and for vaccination status.

![img: data preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jefedigital/cuny-data-607-projects/main/vaccination-data/docs/data_img.png)

With this data and the inclusion of some broader domain knowledge, we will attempt to answer the following questions:

1. Do you have enough information to calculate the total population?  What does this total population represent?	

2. Calculate the Efficacy vs. Disease; explain your results.

3. From your calculation of efficacy vs. disease, are you able to compare the rate of severe cases in un-vaccinated individuals to that in vaccinated individuals?

## Domain Knowledge

- Based on recent demographic data, the total population of Israel in August 2021 was approximately 9.3 Million. ^[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/latest-population-statistics-for-israel]

- As of February 2021, all Israelis aged 16 and over were eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccinations. ^[https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-02-04/all-israelis-over-16-are-eligible-for-coronavirus-vaccine]

- The Israeli population skews quite young, with approximately 28% of all Israelis aged 14 and under. ^[https://www.statista.com/statistics/526596/age-structure-in-israel/]

- "Full vaccination" is defined as having received two injections of an approved COVID-19 vaccine. ^[https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-02-04/all-israelis-over-16-are-eligible-for-coronavirus-vaccine]

## Data Preparation
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# import libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

# load data
df <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jefedigital/cuny-data-607-projects/main/vaccination-data/data/israel_vax_data.csv', skip=1)
df <- select(df,!last_col()) # drop last col

# bind alternating rows
df_odd <- filter(df, row_number() %% 2 == 0)
df_even <- filter(df, row_number() %% 2 == 1)
df <- bind_cols(df_even, df_odd)

# drop extra columns
df <- select(df,-6,-9,-10) 

# relabel
names(df) <- c('age','count_non','count_full','severe_non',
               'severe_full','pct_non','pct_full')

# remove '%' characters, convert all cols to numeric
df$pct_non <- str_replace(df$pct_non,'%','')
df$pct_full <- str_replace(df$pct_full,'%','')
df <- type_convert(df)

# convert to pct
df$pct_non <- round(df$pct_non / 100,4) 
df$pct_full <- round(df$pct_full / 100,4)

# final dataframe
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(pct_partial = 1 - (pct_non + pct_full)) %>%
  mutate(count_partial = round(count_full / pct_full * pct_partial)) %>% 
  mutate(efficacy = 1- ((severe_full/10^4) / (severe_non/10^4)))

# display the dataframe
kable(df)

# some additional variables for analysis
total_pop <- 9227700

total_non <- sum(df$count_non)
total_full <- sum(df$count_full)
total_partial <- sum(df$count_partial)

total_eligible <- sum(total_non, total_full, total_partial)

total_ineligible <- total_pop - total_eligible
pct_ineligible <- round(total_ineligible / total_pop,4)
```

## Discussion

**Do you have enough information to calculate the total population?  What does this total population represent?**

In examining the table, we notice that the provided totals of un-vaccinated and fully vaccinated as a percentage of the population does not total 1.  The under 50 difference is -3.7% and over 50 is -1.7%.  

We assume this represents people that were age-eligible, but only partially vaccinated at the time of the survey (having received only one injection.)

We can estimate this 'total vaccine eligible population' at `r toString(total_eligible)`.  Subtracting this from the total Israeli population yields `r toString(total_ineligible)`, representing about 22.5% of all Israelis, and a round estimate of all age-ineligible citizens 14 and under, and/or those who are otherwise vaccine-ineligible.


**Calculate the Efficacy vs. Disease; explain your results.**

**Are you able to compare the rate of severe cases in un-vaccinated individuals to that in vaccinated individuals?**

Efficacy vs. Disease is defined as 1 - (% fully vaxed severe cases per 100K / % not vaxed severe cases per 100K), and and additional column is added to the dataframe to calculate this rate.

We observe very different Efficacy rates per age group. The under-50 group produces a 75% Efficacy rate with far fewer severe cases per 100k among the vaccinated.  However the story is quite different for the over-50 group, with 69% **more** severe cases per 100k among the vaccinated. 

It would be difficult to explain these results without a great deal more of information - there could be a number of confounding variables at play including rates of co-morbidity and overall health between age groups, rates of hospitalization among vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups, and others.
